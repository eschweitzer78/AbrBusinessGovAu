</a>

## Configure Your Authentication GUID

Check the details, including usage terms, on the [Business Registry website](https://abr.business.gov.au/Tools/WebServices), accept the web services agreement and get your GUID, which will be sent to you by email.

Once received, in the Salesforce setup, manage records for the `AbrBusinessGovAu Setting` custom metadata type (Setup > Custom Code > Custom Metadata Types).

On the management screen, create a new record. Make sure your select the *Authentication GUID* type, and enter your GUID as the value. The GUID has a format like `1234567898-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789ab`. 

## Activate the ABR Lookup page

In Setup, navigate to the Lightning App Builder and locate the `ABR_Lookup` app page. Edit it in order to activate it.

## Test It

Use the application waffle in the upper right corner of the screen to navigate to the `ABR Lookup` application. Enter either an ABN or a partial company name, and hit the `Lookup` button.

## What's next

Our future plans include:
- Extending the APEX class for more operations and more filters,
- Enabling for use from a Flow
- Rewriting the Aura widgets in LWC
